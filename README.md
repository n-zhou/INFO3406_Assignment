# INFO3406_Assignment

## Stage 1
The objective of this stage is to explore a data set and define a research question based on a research/business requirement. The Activities include:
1. selecting a dataset;
2. exploring, summarising and preparing the data; and
3. defining the problem and project requirements.

The report for Stage 1 consists of three sections. Problem, Approach and Data. It is a two page report (not counting the title page and references or appendix) worth **13%** of our overall marks in INFO3406.

### Section 1: Problem
* Describe the problem from a general perspective, highlighting the business/research need.
* List the questions we will answer in stage 2 of the project.

### Section 2: Approach
* We will describe the approach we will take to solving the problem and any requirements. This is our plan for stage 2.

### Section 3: Data
* Describe the data from a general perspective eg. source, size, fields of interest.
* How did we acquire the data
* Describe any exploratory analysis we have done to refine our understanding of the data and research question. One or two supporting figures would be great.
* Describe any data preparation eg. transformation, sampling, cleaning.
* Which tools did we use to clean and explore the data set?
