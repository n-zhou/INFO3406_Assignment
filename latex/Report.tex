    \section{Section 1: Problem}
    The results of the 2016 Presidential elections came as surprise to the whole world. The candidate Hillary Clinton \
    was ahead in the polls throughout the whole election cycle. Yet when November 8 came the victor was none other than\
    Donald J. Trump. The problem that we are trying to identify is where everyone went wrong in their predictions.
    \newline \newline
    The questions we will be answering in Stage 2 are:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item blah blah blah?
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Section 2: Approach}
    In this section we will describe the approach we will be taking to solving the problem and any requirements. This is our plan for stage 2.
